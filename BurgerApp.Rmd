## Fancy Burger App

This app is a way to calculate the bills for a burger place.

--- .class #id 

## Simple Assumptions

To keep the app simple, I have assumed only two products: burger and fries.


--- 
## Menu Prices

Burgers are priced at $4.50 each and box of fries at $2.00 each. Then there is option of extra sauce at 50 cents and tipping.
Although a very simple idea, this app can be modified to create a detailed billing form. We can add more menu items and offer more flexible number of units of fries (kinda unrealistic here.)

## Function behind the calculation

This is the function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
s<-function(Burgers, Fries, Tips, ExtraSauce) {
   if (ExtraSauce == TRUE) {
  y<-Burgers*4.5+as.numeric(Fries)*2.00 + Tips + 0.5
   } else {
  y<-Burgers*4.5+as.numeric(Fries)*2.00+Tips
   }
  print(y) 
}
}


```
